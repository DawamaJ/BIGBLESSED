        <p>I Rarely do we recognize the magnitude of our words. Out of habit, we tell ourselves “I’m scared,” I’m tired,” 
                “I’m desperate,” or “I’m not good enough.” We don’t realize that our words become the truth of our lives. 
                What we speak, we embody. </p>

                Join HuffPost Plus“I am” is the single most important phrase you will ever speak. 
                That’s because what follows these two words dictates who you are. 
                It becomes even more profound when you re-define yourself repeatedly throughout the day: 
                “I am confident,” “I am beautiful,” “I am loved” are just a few of the endless declarations 
                you can make to replenish your well-being and re-center your soul. 
                Reciting such mantras with purpose and conviction can shift your perception entirely. 
                And when you see things differently, you do things differently.</p>
